Phase 1 project for Flatiron School web dev

Description:
The Lion King quiz game uses character information fetched from https://api.disneyapi.dev and challenges the user to
respond with all of the main character names from the Lion King movie (original).

How it works:
The user will click the start button and the text box for the user response will appear and be given focus.
The user must guess the names of the 14 Lion King characters before 60 seconds expire. The casing of the user response does not matter. Furthermore, the user will not have to press enter to submit a response. Once a correct response is typed into the box, it will automatically be enetered (if the name hasn't been guessed already.) The user will be awarded a point and the text box will automatically clear. If the user enters an incorrect response or a character named that has already been entered then nothing will happen and the user will have to manually delete their response and try again. Once i correct answer is entered the character that was quessed correctly card will appear below. Once the game ends the text box will become inactive and the restart button will appear. The user score is also output under the grid containing the character cards. Clicking restart will reload the page.
